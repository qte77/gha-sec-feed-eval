# Agent Instructions for gha-sec-feed-eval

Behavioural rules for AI agents working on this evaluator. **Shared dev
workflow lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** (test conventions,
commit + PR conventions, branch protection, GHA workflow rules, changelog
fragments, release flow); this document carries only what's agent-specific.
For project overview see [README.md](README.md); for module map + data
flow see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Core Rules

- Follow KISS, DRY, YAGNI, AHA — simplest solution that works, no
  speculative features, no premature abstractions
- **Never assume missing context** — ask if uncertain about requirements
- **Never hallucinate libraries** — only use packages verified in
  `pyproject.toml`
- **Always confirm file paths exist** before referencing in code or tests
- **Never delete existing code** unless explicitly instructed
- **Touch only task-related code** — bug fixes don't need surrounding
  cleanup
- **Strict pydantic** — every structured payload is a `BaseModel`; CLI /
  env via `BaseSettings(cli_parse_args=True)`. No `TypedDict`, no
  `dataclass`.
- **HTTP through `http_client.py` only** — 5-host allowlist enforced. Do
  not import `requests` / `httpx` directly elsewhere.
- **Default categories live at `categories/default.yaml`** (NOT under
  `config/` — the Claude Code bwrap sandbox phantoms `/config`, silently
  routing writes elsewhere). Consumers override via
  `--categories-file path/to/their.yaml`.
- **Vendored data is the source of truth** — ATT&CK + D3FEND are static
  JSON under `vendor/`. Do not add runtime fetching of these inside CI.

## Decision Framework

**Priority order:** User instructions → AGENTS.md → CONTRIBUTING.md →
README.md → existing code patterns

**Information sources:**

- Requirements: task description (primary), handoff brief if referenced
- Run / lint / test commands: `make help`
- Project version: `pyproject.toml` (single source of truth)
- Library API shapes (pydantic, scriv, etc.): `context7` MCP, not
  training data

**Anti-scope-creep:** Implement only what is explicitly requested.
Prefer landing small working slices over comprehensive rewrites within
a single PR.

## Quality Thresholds

Subjective gut-check before starting any task. If below threshold:
gather more context or ask the user.

- **Context** 8/10 — understand requirements, codebase patterns,
  contract shapes (C1 + C2)
- **Clarity** 7/10 — clear implementation path and expected outcomes
- **Alignment** 8/10 — follows project patterns, respects
  KISS / DRY / YAGNI / AHA
- **Success** 7/10 — confident in completing task correctly

## Agent-specific reminders

- **Pre-task:** read AGENTS.md → CONTRIBUTING.md → README.md → relevant
  `docs/` files; confirm quality thresholds; check `make help` for
  available recipes.
- **Verify before claiming done.** `make validate` must pass locally
  (or document why a step couldn't run — e.g. sandbox restrictions);
  CI is authoritative.
- **Strict TDD is opt-in per feature.** Default is topic-grouped
  commits with tests + implementation co-committed. When using strict
  TDD, one commit per phase (red → green → optional refactor).
- **Stop-and-ask triggers** per
  [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md): scope expansion beyond
  MVP, C1 schema bump from producer, scoring formula producing obviously
  wrong results on sanity check (CVSS-10 + KEV-listed < 8), `mitreattack-python`
  unmaintained, STIX bundle URL moves.
